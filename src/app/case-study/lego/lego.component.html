    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>As a challenge and as a result of having to use Bootstap and Material Design in several project I decided to make my own css library. Most of the projects I work on have either one or both CSS frameworks attached, which is not always my choice. I continually have to fight with it to override the styles of certain components. I decided to build a component library based on the styles that I normally override as a blanket foundation. Also, in creating my own framework, it would reduce the time it takes to set up a new websites scaffolding and allow me to concentrate more on the layout and design.</p>
    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>All of it. I had of course worked with CSS and Sass but creating my own library that services the whole with edge cases built in out was a huge challenge and undertaking.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Learned</h3>
    <p>For a while I had this library as just static HTML documentation that lived on my computer and when I needed it I would serve it on my local host. While transitioning my portfolio website with Angular 6 I decided that I would seperate out this library and make its own Angular project. </p>
